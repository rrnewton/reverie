/*
 * Sets O_NONBLOCK on the container's stdin and then performs a socket-family
 * read on it.
 *
 * This pairing is the one that breaks if Detcore's guest-visible O_NONBLOCK and
 * its own physical view of the descriptor are allowed to disagree.
 * `ioaction_based_on_fd_status` panics on `virt && !phys` -- "we cannot simulate
 * nonblocking behavior when set to blocking mode in the kernel" -- so a change
 * that models the flag without asking the kernel makes the next socket syscall
 * on that descriptor abort the container.
 *
 * It uses `recv` rather than `read` because the socket handler reaches the
 * nonblocking invariant directly. That keeps this regression independent of
 * the fd-type branch in the ordinary read handler.
 *
 * The caller supplies a socket as stdin with a byte already readable, so this
 * is not a question about blocking: the recv can be satisfied immediately, and
 * anything other than one byte means the classification path went wrong.
