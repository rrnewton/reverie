"""Shared pytest fixtures for the dagrun Python tests.

The default auto-logging profile store (Feature D) writes CSVs to ``./.dagrun/profiles/``
relative to the CWD whenever a ``run``/``sweep`` executes without ``--perf-dir``/``--no-profile``.
To keep the test run hermetic (no writes into the repo checkout), an autouse fixture points
``$DAGRUN_PROFILE_DIR`` at a throwaway temp directory for every test. Tests that
specifically exercise the true default location or ``--no-profile`` unset this env var themselves.

A second autouse fixture makes the operator build width ambient-proof. ``select_build_jobs``
consults an intent captured from ``$CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`` at IMPORT, so a developer who happens to
have that variable exported turned ``test_build_job_cap.py`` and ``test_sizing.py`` red — a suite
whose verdict depends on the shell that launched it is not a suite. Every test therefore starts
from "the operator stated nothing", and the handful of tests that are ABOUT operator intent set it
for themselves.
