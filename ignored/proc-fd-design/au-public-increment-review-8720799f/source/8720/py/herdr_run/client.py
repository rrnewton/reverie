"""Thin typed wrapper over the ``herdr`` CLI's socket-API subcommands.

Why the CLI and not the socket directly: ``herdr`` already speaks its own protocol version
(``protocol: 17`` at time of writing) and ships compatibility checks. Re-implementing the wire
format here would create a second, silently-drifting client.

**The one thing that must not be got wrong**: the Herdr SERVER is what determines whether panes are
inside or outside the agent sandbox, because panes are its children. If a confined agent starts the
server itself, every pane it creates inherits that confinement and the whole tool becomes an
elaborate way to get the same 403 — silently, because nothing about the pane would look different.
So :meth:`HerdrClient.ensure_server` always launches through ``systemd-run --user``, which reparents
the server onto the user manager outside the jail. Control CALLS do not need that (the server's unix
socket is reachable from inside; measured on devbig014 2026-08-06), and default to going direct.
