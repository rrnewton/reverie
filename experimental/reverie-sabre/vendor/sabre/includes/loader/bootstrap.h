/* Optional supervisor protocol. An ordinary kernel rejects this prctl option.
 * The supervisor must authenticate this instruction in the exact launched
 * loader, the stopped thread/image generation, and every pointed-to extent.
 * Neither the option number nor a request's argument shape is authority.
 * IMAGE is an acknowledgement only after the supervisor validates the real
 * final stack/auxv, finds exactly one writable 16-byte AT_RANDOM target, and
 * completes its initialization there. The loader does not validate auxv.
 *
 * Enabled execution must make no rewritten non-plugin getrandom call before
 * IMAGE. That includes loader-internal code between the initial rewrite and
 * the IMAGE stop; a future such call is a fatal unsupported phase, never a
 * fallback to host entropy. The native phase control checks that such a call
 * is fatal; it does not establish that no loader-internal caller exists.
 *
 * The supervisor must write no more than TAKE's capacity, retire the state
 * only after a successful bounded write, and reject subsequent takes (for
 * example with ESTALE). A failed/short-capacity transfer must not consume it.
 * A zero/oversized success violates the protocol: the consumer must fail,
 * never retry by constructing fresh state or replaying random requests.
