/// two reasons:
///
///   - It observes every supported fork, including a raw `SYS_fork` or a raw
///     plain `SYS_clone` issued without libc (Go's runtime, hand-written
///     `syscall(2)` call sites). A `pthread_atfork` child handler would see
///     only forks that went through glibc's `fork()` wrapper and would silently
///     leave such a child on the parent's connection.
///   - It runs before the child's `handle_thread_start` callback, which is the
///     child's first opportunity to issue an RPC. A `pthread_atfork` handler
///     runs later, inside the libc wrapper after the fork syscall returns, so a
///     tool that sends an RPC from `handle_thread_start` would be attributed to
///     the parent.

/// [`CoordinatorRpc::send_rpc`]; this is only a flag store, so it stays safe in
/// the restricted post-fork context.
