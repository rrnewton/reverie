//! The half of the runtime that runs inside the guest process, shared by the
//! in-guest backends: the syscall event every trap and hook path builds and
//! the register context they save, the allocator that keeps Tool callbacks
//! off libc's heap, the synchronous coordinator RPC handle an in-guest Tool
//! sends its global requests through, the Tool host that runs the Tool, and
//! the fallback continuation that runs a trapped call in ordinary context,
//! and the RCB clock that measures the guest's own progress.
//! The rest of the trap path and the launcher move here in the following
//! steps of the in-guest plan (<https://github.com/rrnewton/hermit/issues/3520>, step C3).
