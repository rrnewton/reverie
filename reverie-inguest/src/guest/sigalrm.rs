//! Signal phase 1, the runtime's half: the guest's virtual SIGALRM action and
//! signal mask (dev-hermit
//! `ai_docs/transient/liteinst-inguest-signal-handlers-design-20261007.md`,
//! sections 3, 5 and 6; step I3b).
//!
//! While a guest SIGALRM handler is installed ("handled"), the guest never
//! sees the physical state:
//! - the physical SIGALRM action is the runtime's trampoline, returning
//!   through the runtime's restorer; the guest's action is virtual, and is
//!   what queries return;
//! - the physical mask always blocks SIGALRM, so no physical SIGALRM reaches
//!   guest code outside a delivery the runtime prepared; the guest's mask is
//!   virtual: physical = (virtual ∪ {SIGALRM}) minus the reserved signals;
//! - `rt_sigpending` hides the physical SIGALRM (the scheduler's ledger, not
//!   the kernel, holds a handled process's pending SIGALRM; Detcore adds it);
//! - a `sigaltstack` query returns a disabled stack.
//!
//! The state is per process. Phase 1's in-guest processes have one thread
//! (a non-fork clone is refused), so the process's virtual mask is that
//! thread's; a fork child inherits all of it with the memory.
//!
//! Everything here runs inside the guest call's own turn, from the call
//! Detcore forwards, never concurrently.
