//! The shared SIGSYS dispatcher of the in-guest runtime. A trapped syscall is
//! one of three things: a Tool callback's own syscall, which runs natively
//! after the runtime's protections; a trap the backend patches into a hook,
//! which the trap defers to; or a trap no hook takes, which the fallback
//! continuation runs in ordinary context (or which is refused with
//! `EOPNOTSUPP` where the continuation cannot run). The backend supplies its
//! part through a [`TrapSeam`]. The default methods are a backend that
//! patches nothing: every trap goes to the continuation.
