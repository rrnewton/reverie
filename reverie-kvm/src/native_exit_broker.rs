//! Private source candidate for native terminal socket-reference retirement.
//!
//! This module does not install a runtime, start a guest, or publish a guest
//! terminal receipt. The caller supplies exclusive startup authority and owns a
//! continuously running dispatcher. Every job and its original socket-reference
//! vector remain in that dispatcher until completion or explicit retained error;
//! dropping a waiting future must not drop them. See `JobProgress`.
//!
//! Bootstrap and explicit exec-client setup may wait before guest admission.
//! Parent-side job methods use nonblocking
//! internal socket I/O. `advance` retires original socket references only after
//! the worker has acknowledged the complete transferred set. The trusted worker
//! then exits natively, and the broker's actual wait result completes the job.
//! Unexpected external worker destruction between ACK and parent retirement is
//! an adverse-host failure; ACK is not an unkillable kernel reference lease.
//!
//! Broker control/job channels, identity pidfds and exported client channels
//! can outlive a single call. `reverie_process::launch_window` protects transient
//! opens, not these long-lived owners. CLOEXEC does not isolate a forked tracee
//! that never execs, such as `reverie_ptrace::spawn_fn_with_config`; this module
//! does not arrange their exclusion from that child. Embedders must keep live
//! broker use separate from such in-process no-exec launches unless they provide
//! that exclusion for every broker descriptor throughout the launch. Neither
//! the launch-window guard nor descriptor numbering establishes that isolation.
