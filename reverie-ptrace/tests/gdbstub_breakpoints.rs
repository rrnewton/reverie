//! Software breakpoints that Reverie's GDB server sets less than 8 bytes apart
//! must not disturb each other.
//!
//! The server sets a breakpoint by writing `int3` (0xcc) over the first byte
//! of an 8-byte word that it reads and writes through ptrace, so the word also
//! covers the 7 bytes after the breakpoint. Removing the breakpoint must put
//! back that one byte only. When it wrote back the whole word as it was read
//! at insertion, it also undid every change made since to those 7 bytes:
//!
//! - It erased a breakpoint inserted there later. GDB inserts breakpoints in
//!   ascending address order and steps over a breakpoint that it has hit by
//!   removing it, single-stepping and inserting it again, so stepping over a
//!   breakpoint on one short source line removed the breakpoint on the next,
//!   and the program ran past it.
//! - It wrote back the `int3` of a breakpoint there that was live when this
//!   one was inserted and was removed first, leaving a stray `int3`. Reverie
//!   suppresses a SIGTRAP that no breakpoint accounts for, so the guest ran on
//!   from the byte after the `int3`, inside an instruction.
//!
//! Each test drives the server over the GDB remote protocol, as GDB does,
//! against a guest built from `fixtures/gdbstub_adjacent_breakpoints.c`, with
//! two breakpoint sites 6 bytes apart. It checks where the guest stops and
//! reads the guest's code through `/proc/<pid>/mem`, which shows the inserted
//! `int3` bytes that the server's `m` packet hides.
