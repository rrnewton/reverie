/// Who owns a guest thread: the single axis that governs *both* how the thread
/// executes *and* who owns its thread-synchronization primitives (`futex`,
/// `CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID`).
///
/// These two concerns must never disagree. If a thread executes under the Tool
/// (registered in the Tool's scheduler) while its `futex` is serviced by the
/// host — or vice versa — a `pthread_join` deadlocks: the joiner's `FUTEX_WAIT`
/// waits in one domain while the exiting thread's `CLEARTID` wake fires in the
/// other, so the wake never reaches the waiter. Collapsing both concerns onto
/// this single enum makes that split-brain state *unrepresentable*: a thread is
/// either wholly `Tool`-owned or wholly `Host`-owned, never half of each.
///
/// A backend that runs child threads (e.g. the KVM backend, where each guest
/// thread runs on its own vCPU) selects the ownership for a tool's threads from
/// [`Tool::thread_ownership`] and uses the *same* value to decide (a) whether to
/// drive the thread through the Tool loop and (b) whether its `futex` routes to
/// the Tool. Backends that do not run child threads (e.g. ptrace, which already
/// routes every subscribed `futex` to the Tool) may ignore this value.

/// must consume partially initialized state without requiring guest execution
/// or a normal response from an abandoned callback. This contract covers
/// returned runtime errors; arbitrary panic unwinding is not guaranteed to
/// invoke consuming hooks.

/// The ordinary ptrace backend owns execution-control state and wait statuses.
/// Tools must use Guest/backend APIs for resumes, stepping, detach/attach,
/// tracing options, wait/reap, and mutations of registers or signal information
/// (including PTRACE_SETSIGINFO). Raw operations outside those APIs invalidate
/// its current-stop ownership contract. Read-only ptrace/memory observations
/// are permitted; supported Guest injection can replace the current stop.
///
/// For ordinary non-syscall Errno-only callbacks, the return type erases causal
/// provenance. If a same-generation observation justifies yielding to the
/// original lifecycle owner, the callback's errno is retained as a diagnostic
/// while that owner supplies actual exit or exec status. A live callback error
/// remains fatal; an actually received Error::Tool or Error::Io is always fatal.
