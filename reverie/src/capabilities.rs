//! Static facts about how a backend runs a guest.
//!
//! A tool that models a guest (for example a deterministic scheduler) sometimes
//! has to act differently depending on what the backend underneath it does: is a
//! guest thread a host task that a host signal can reach, does the kernel finish
//! robust-list cleanup before the tool hears about a thread exit, does the tool
//! share the guest's descriptor table? [`BackendCapabilities`] answers those
//! questions, one field per fact, so the tool reads the fact it needs instead of
//! asking which backend it is running on.
//!
//! # Scope: one answer per run
//!
//! Every field is a property of the backend for the whole run. One backend runs
//! every guest thread of a run, none of these facts change while it runs, and a
//! tool that runs inside the guest receives its configuration (including this
//! struct) once, before the first guest callback. Facts that depend on a
//! particular thread or a particular request (for example where a parked signal
//! may be observed) are not here; they stay queries on [`Guest`](crate::Guest).
//!
//! # Where the values live
//!
//! The per-backend values are associated constants of this type, in the core
//! crate, rather than only in each backend crate. A host such as Hermit selects
//! a backend at run time and must configure its tool for backends it was not
//! built to link (some backends are optional, heavy builds). Each backend crate
//! still answers for itself: [`Backend::capabilities`](crate::Backend::capabilities)
//! for [`Backend`](crate::Backend) implementors, and an inherent
//! `capabilities()` on backends that do not implement that trait. Those return
//! the matching constant. The tests below pin every constant field by field,
//! and `reverie-kvm` also checks that its user address limit is the one its
//! executor enforces.
//!
//! # Adding a field
//!
//! The struct is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so code outside this crate cannot build
//! one field by field: it starts from a constant. A new field must be given a
//! value in every constant below; there is no default to fall back on.
