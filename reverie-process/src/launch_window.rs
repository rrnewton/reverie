//! Keeps the tracer's transient descriptors out of guest launches on other
//! host threads of the same process.
//!
//! A *transient open* is a descriptor a tracer thread opens and closes inside
//! one synchronous call, such as a procfs read. A *launch* is the parent-side
//! sequence that allocates a new child's descriptors (pipes) and forks it. If
//! a transient open overlaps another thread's launch, the descriptor takes a
//! number from the launch's descriptor budget (its pipe can fail with EMFILE
//! under a tight `RLIMIT_NOFILE`), and the forked child inherits it. A no-exec
//! guest (`spawn_fn_with_config`) closes only descriptors 3 to 255, so it keeps
//! a numbered-256-or-above copy for its whole run
//! (<https://github.com/rrnewton/reverie/issues/912>, rows 25 and 26 of
//! <https://github.com/rrnewton/reverie/issues/845>).
//!
//! One process-wide lock excludes the two across threads: [`Launch`] is held
//! exclusively from a launch's first descriptor allocation until `clone`
//! returns in the parent (for a launch through libc's `fork`, until its
//! descriptors exist; see below), and [`TransientOpen`] is held shared from a
//! transient open to its close. Transient opens of different threads never
//! wait for each other, only for another thread's launch in progress, and for
//! that at most [`OPEN_WAIT_LIMIT`] (below). A launch waits until no other
//! thread holds a transient open. Neither guard may be held across an
//! `.await`.
//!
//! A thread never waits for its own guards. An open inside the thread's own
//! launch, or a launch nested inside it, proceeds and leaves the outer launch
//! held. So does a launch inside the thread's own open, which then becomes
//! part of the launch until the launch ends; that open's descriptor reaches
//! the child, as it would without the lock. Two threads that each hold a transient open
//! and each begin a launch inside it would wait for each other's open; no
//! Reverie launch site begins a launch under its own open.
//!
//! A guarded scope must therefore not wait for another thread: that thread
//! may be launching, or may wait for a launch, which waits for the guard. A
//! scope makes system calls on its descriptor and computes, and nothing else:
//! - It does not log. A log subscriber may block on a launching thread, for
//!   example one that writes through a launched child. Code that may run under
//!   a guard and needs to log hands the event to [`run_after_guards`], which
//!   runs it once the thread holds no guard.
//! - It takes no lock, and no cache initializer that another thread may be
//!   running.
//! - It may allocate. A thread that holds an allocator's lock and waits on
//!   this lock waits only for a launch in progress, which allocates nothing
//!   (below), and for at most [`OPEN_WAIT_LIMIT`].
//!
//! Only system calls run under [`Launch`]: the ones that make the child's
//! descriptors, and the `clone`. Nothing under it allocates or frees memory,
//! takes a lock, or calls code from outside Reverie. What a launch needs that
//! allocates is built before the guard begins. A launch that waits holds
//! nothing: other threads' opens keep beginning until it takes the lock,
//! which it does only once none is in progress.
//!
//! A system call can still wait for another thread of this process: a
//! seccomp filter on the launching thread can hand its `pipe2` to a
//! user-notification supervisor here, and that supervisor may need a
//! transient open before it answers. So a transient open waits for another
//! thread's launch for at most [`OPEN_WAIT_LIMIT`], and then proceeds while
//! the launch is still held, as it would without the lock: its descriptor can
//! then take a number from that launch, or reach its child. A launch that
//! nothing outside it holds up runs only system calls and typically ends
//! well within the limit, though scheduling delay can stretch it. The limit
//! is checked between bounded futex waits of 10 ms, so an open can wait
//! somewhat longer than the limit before it gives up.
//!
//! A launch through libc's `fork` (`spawn_fn_with_config`) ends its guard
//! once its pipes exist, before it calls `fork`: `fork` runs the process's
//! `pthread_atfork` handlers, which may run any code, including code that
//! waits for another thread that waits for the guard. A transient open of
//! another thread that begins after the guard ends and is still open at the
//! `fork` therefore reaches that child, as it did without the lock
//! (<https://github.com/rrnewton/reverie/issues/927>).
//!
//! A launch must not hold [`Launch`] while it waits for the new child to start
//! (an exec-error pipe, a seccomp-notification handoff): the child's setup can
//! wait on another tracer thread, and that thread may need a transient open.
//! Descriptors a launch keeps open after `clone` returns, such as its
//! exec-error reader, are therefore not excluded from other threads' launches
//! while the child starts.
//!
//! A child forked through libc runs a `pthread_atfork` handler, and a child of
//! this crate's raw `clone` resets the lock at entry, so neither inherits a
//! guard another thread held, or work the forking thread deferred to
//! [`run_after_guards`]. After the reset the child's copies of the forking
//! thread's [`Launch`] guards release nothing, provided they are dropped before
//! the child begins a launch of its own: a copy dropped during the child's own
//! launch would end that launch. A child made by a raw `clone`/`clone3`
//! elsewhere must not take either guard.
//!
//! The lock lives here, below `reverie-core`, `safeptrace` and
//! `reverie-ptrace`, so that the transient opens in all three take the same
//! lock. It is not part of Reverie's tool API.
//!
//! Descriptors held beyond one call (pidfds, perf counters, a gdb client's
//! files) and forks outside Reverie are not covered.
