# Reverie LiteInst

Part of [Hermit](https://hermetic-infra.org) and
[Reverie](https://docs.rs/reverie-core). See the
[API documentation](https://docs.rs/reverie-liteinst) for this experimental
backend and [`hermit-run`](https://crates.io/crates/hermit-run) for the CLI.
Hermit's `liteinst` feature is optional and off by default.

`reverie-liteinst` is an experimental Linux x86-64 Reverie backend built on the
standalone `liteinst2` patching library, the shared `reverie-inguest` runtime,
and `reverie-rpc-transport`.

## Preload and allocator ownership

The `reverie-liteinst` core is an allocator-neutral rlib. The standalone runtime
is the separate cdylib-only `reverie-liteinst-preload` package:

```sh
cargo build -p reverie-liteinst-preload
```

Cargo produces `libreverie_liteinst_preload.so`; Hermit installs that artifact
under its existing resource name `libreverie_liteinst.so`. The leaf owns its
constructor, glibc compatibility code, static unwinder and unconditional
`PrivateToolAllocator`. The old core `preload-constructor` feature is a deprecated
no-op, including in workspace feature unions. Linking the core into a host
program does not replace that program's allocator or add a LiteInst constructor.
The independent legacy `reverie-inguest/preload-constructor` feature still owns
its own constructor if another dependency enables it; the core disables that
dependency's default features.

A Tool-specific preload must declare `reverie_liteinst::PrivateToolAllocator` as
its root `#[global_allocator]`. Ordinary Rust allocation uses only the reusable
32 MiB Tool arena and the process-lifetime 32 MiB installation arena, before,
during and after callbacks. Exhaustion returns null through `GlobalAlloc` and
never falls back to the guest allocator. Reallocation and deallocation preserve
the original arena's ownership across scope changes. A foreign-address ownership
mismatch terminates through the trusted syscall gate before reading a header.

Legacy embedded Tools may explicitly declare `ScopedToolAllocator` to retain the
prior dispatch/installation-scoped policy. The RPC and lifecycle fixtures and
example preload do so; this also preserves the examples rlib's existing allocator
propagation into its host binaries. These legacy roots are not isolated preloads.
Every `install_tool` variant checks a fallible compiler-selected allocation in a
dispatch scope before creating a Tool, opening RPC or installing a filter. A
System-only root is refused with `EOPNOTSUPP`; exhaustion returns `ENOMEM`.

This boundary covers compiler-selected Rust allocation. It does not isolate
allocations inside libc or the loader, guest TLS, callback stacks, mapping
placement or memory permissions. Those require separate barriers; the arenas
remain bounded storage, not a security sandbox or a claim of complete Tool
memory isolation.

## Event path

1. A tool-specific DSO calls `install_tool::<T>` from its preload constructor.
   It connects to the coordinator and receives `T::GlobalState::Config` before
   seccomp is active.
2. `reverie-inguest` installs the SIGSYS handler, alternate stack, trusted
   syscall gate, and seccomp filter.
3. The first syscall at an instruction reaches SIGSYS. The LiteInst dispatcher
   installs a replace-first hook and changes the saved signal-context RIP to the
   generated trampoline entry. An unpatchable syscall uses the deferred entry
   described below, leaving its instruction bytes intact.
4. After `sigreturn`, the trampoline invokes `T::handle_syscall_event` in normal
   guest context. The first invocation and later patched invocations therefore
   use the same tool path; the first site trap is not also a tool execution.
5. reverie-inguest's Tool host (`reverie_inguest::guest::host`, whose `Guest`
   is `InGuest`) supplies in-process memory/register access and syscall
   injection through the trusted gate. `CoordinatorRpc<G>` serializes
   `GlobalRPC` messages over the same UDS/bincode framing as
   `reverie-rpc-transport::RpcServer<G>`. The launcher accepts concurrent local
   connections against the one coordinator-owned global state and cancels any
   outstanding connection tasks when the guest run ends.

The regression proof reports `calls=32 traps=1 hooks=32` and sends a real
Reverie tool RPC for every callback.

### Unpatchable syscalls

In typed Tool mode, a syscall without a supported patch window returns from the
real kernel SIGSYS frame into an ordinary assembly entry. That entry calls the
same Tool driver as installed syscall hooks, including six arguments, error
results, tail injection, retries, and coordinator RPC. It retains no pointer
into the expired kernel signal frame and does not rewrite guest text.

The entry saves registers below the guest's 128-byte red-zone, aligns its
extended-state area to 64 bytes, and sizes that area from CPUID leaf 0xD. XSAVE
and XRSTOR use every user-state component enabled in XCR0; there is no fixed
component mask. Machines without OS-enabled XSAVE use FXSAVE64/FXRSTOR64.
The XSAVE header is zeroed before saving. On OS-enabled PKU systems the entry
saves the original PKRU in a register, opens runtime memory access before any
global or TLS read, and puts the original PKRU back in the saved image with its
correct initial-state bit. Nested Tool syscall traps reopen runtime access;
their real signal return restores the interrupted permissions. The callback
receives an empty x87 stack, default FP controls and a cleared direction flag;
the guest's FP state, permissions, flags and libc errno are restored afterward.
After the final XRSTOR, only registers and the guest-accessible frame are read.
Future runtime or clock boundaries must finish before that restore. The syscall outputs remain RAX
(result), RCX (continuation PC), and R11 (saved flags).

The installing thread initializes and touches its continuation TLS before
seccomp installation. A supported COW fork inherits that initialized state.
Each such thread owns one pending continuation; a second preparation while it
is occupied refuses without replacing it. Future thread support must initialize
these TLS keys in ordinary child-thread startup before its first trap, rather
than first touching dynamic TLS in a signal handler. After dispatch, the saved
RCX owns the return address and return reads no mutable TLS continuation.
Nested Tool-internal syscalls use the existing trusted gate and do not acquire
another continuation. Callable guest signal handlers remain unsupported;
this guard does not add asynchronous callback support. Callbacks must obey the
ordinary no-unwind ABI and preserve TLS bases. HookContext IP/SP fields retain
the existing register API's metadata semantics.

The guest stack must accommodate the callback stack plus at most
`335 + round_up(CPUID.0D.0:EBX, 64)` bytes below the original RSP. This includes
the 128-byte red-zone, 144-byte register frame, at most 63 alignment bytes and
the full state area. The FXSAVE case needs at most 847 bytes plus the callback
stack. Initialization checks size arithmetic and rejects an area smaller than
the XSAVE header or larger than the signed stack-adjustment bound. The actual
CPUID size describes the complete standard layout for the actual XCR0 mask;
there is no smaller fixed allocation that could omit a high component.

This may require more stack than the installed-hook path on an AMX host:
a 11008-byte enabled state area needs at most 11343 bytes before the callback
stack. The full mask preserves state that an AMX-permitted guest can use.
XFD gates use of permission-controlled state; XSAVE records the initial-state
status of disabled components, and XRSTOR initializes components whose saved
XSTATE_BV bits are clear. The entry preserves those CPU-provided bits for all
components other than the explicitly restored PKRU. AMX/XFD execution has not
been tested on the current AMD host; preserving the full mask is not a claim
of measured AMX coverage.

`tests/rpc_tool.rs` covers an RX page ending in `syscall; ret`, with six traps,
zero installed hooks, exact original bytes, Tool results distinct from native,
seven RPCs, all arguments, errno, retry, tail injection, GPRs, flags, red-zone
and XMM0. A separate fixture seeds x87, MXCSR, XMM and the host-enabled YMM,
opmask, ZMM and PKRU components, then requires byte-exact saved-state equality
across the Tool callback. It first verifies equality across a native syscall
and detects the callback's real state clobber when restoration is omitted.
It reports the actual XCR0 mask and image size. Components absent from that
host are not execution-tested; this is not a Hermit determinism or parity
qualification. No XSAVE header exception is used in these comparisons.

A separate protection-key fixture uses an actual nondefault-key stack and
checks PKRU zero and key0 access denied, full state, exact reported RSP, Tool
results and RPC with the alternate signal stack both enabled and disabled.
Before both native and Tool runs it explicitly unregisters
its own glibc rseq area through SYS_rseq, then re-registers it once the original
permissions have been restored. Registered rseq metadata must remain readable
and writable for kernel signal/preemption fixups: merely observing one native
raw syscall succeed while denying that metadata does not prove a valid rseq
lifetime. The original registered-rseq native signal failure is separate
kernel/guest lifecycle evidence; no production rseq behavior changes here.
Fork regressions retain installed-hook accounting and require fallback children
to report their own trap, fallback and syscall counts, with two process reports
through the existing Backend statistics API.

## Backend launcher

`LiteinstBackend` implements Reverie's `Backend` trait. It owns the single
`GlobalTool`, starts a UDS coordinator, sets `LD_PRELOAD`, runs the guest,
and returns its status and final global state. Existing preload APIs retain the
`REVERIE_LITEINST_COORDINATOR` environment contract. The example launcher
uses `run_with_output_and_preload_data` instead, passing the coordinator
path and selector in a sealed, dynamically allocated memfd that the preload
discovers, validates, consumes, and closes before guest `main`.
`run_with_preload_data` does the same but returns only the exit status and
leaves the command's stdio exactly as the caller configured it.
`run_with_output_and_preload_data_and_stats`,
`run_with_inherited_stdio_and_preload_data_and_stats` and
`run_with_preload_data_and_stats` do the same and also return one statistics
snapshot per process; the statistics coordinator path still travels in
`REVERIE_LITEINST_STATS_COORDINATOR`. That path is random per run and stays
in the guest's initial environment (`/proc/self/environ`) even after Tool
installation removes the variable, so a statistics run is not leak-free and
its guest-visible behavior must not be compared for determinism.
`REVERIE_LITEINST_TOOL_PRELOAD` must name a DSO that embeds the same concrete
`T` and calls `install_tool::<T>`.

Built-in `strace` and compatibility modes remain available through
`configure_command`. They use the same shared preload and LiteInst hook path
without a coordinator.

### Shared `reverie-inguest` built-in tools

The single `REVERIE_LITEINST_TOOL` selector is a superset of the
LiteInst-native `strace`/`compat` modes: it also accepts the shared
`reverie-inguest` built-ins `passthrough` and `spoof-getpid`, selected through
`configure_command_builtin(&mut Command, BuiltinTool)`. When one of these values
is set, the runtime installs the built-in verbatim through
`reverie_inguest::install_builtin` — it does **not** run the LiteInst patching
dispatcher or prepare instrumentation. This is the LiteInst analog of the
e9patch built-in selector, so the same `BuiltinTool` value installs the same
shared dispatcher in both backends.

`spoof-getpid` proves the fallback/trap path can service **and mutate** a
syscall result: a raw `getpid` returns `reverie_inguest::SPOOF_PID` instead of
the real PID, while `passthrough` leaves the result unchanged. The
`reverie-liteinst-spoof-guest` fixture and the
`spoof_getpid_builtin_mutates_getpid_result` /
`passthrough_builtin_preserves_getpid_result` tests in `tests/strace.rs` cover
both.

### Shared `reverie-inguest` runtime configuration

The in-guest runtime's `SIGSYS` handler is installed through the shared
`reverie-inguest` `RuntimeConfig`, whose `use_alt_stack` knob decides whether the
handler runs on an alternate signal stack. The `RuntimeConfig` and the
controller that honors it live in `reverie-inguest` and are reviewed once; both
ld-preload backends install through that same seam. The launcher selects the
knob per guest with `set_guest_alt_stack(&mut Command, bool)`, which sets the
`REVERIE_LITEINST_ALT_STACK` environment variable (`1`/`0`, `true`/`false`,
`on`/`off`, `yes`/`no`; unset means the shared default, alt stack **on**). Only
the env-var spelling is LiteInst's — this is the LiteInst analog of e9patch's
`REVERIE_E9PATCH_ALT_STACK`, so the same `RuntimeConfig` drives both backends.
It applies to the LiteInst-dispatcher install path (the `strace`/`compat`/Detcore
modes); a shared `BuiltinTool` installs through `reverie_inguest::install_builtin`
with the shared default. The `alt_stack_from_env_value` parser and the
`set_guest_alt_stack` round-trip are unit-tested in `src/runtime.rs` and
`src/lib.rs`.

On systems reporting OSPKE, the shared SIGSYS entry uses a register-only
WRPKRU prefix to open runtime access before touching its stack, siginfo,
ucontext, globals or TLS. Linux's default handler permissions may otherwise
deny a nondefault-key signal stack when `use_alt_stack` is false. Feature
selection runs during installation, before CPUID faulting; the prefix preserves
all three signal arguments and then runs the existing provenance and reentry
checks. It leaves the kernel's saved guest registers and PKRU unchanged, so
signal return restores the interrupted permissions. The non-OSPKE entry is
unchanged. This prefix does not make arbitrary Tool callbacks signal-safe or
add guest signal-handler support.

The shared signal dispatcher reads the interrupted PKRU from the kernel's
standard XSAVE signal frame without changing that frame. Installation validates
the component layout before CPUID faulting. Guest forwarding uses a second exact
trusted syscall site: it applies the saved permissions for the real kernel
operation, then restores runtime permissions using only registers before reading
its return stack. Runtime-private syscalls keep their original gate. Nested Tool
signals carry the nested interrupted rights, so RPC buffers are not treated as
buffers belonging to an earlier outer guest call.

The shared typed Tool host retains `pkey_alloc` permission effects when the
current event owns a saved guest PKRU value. Its original unsubscribed forwarding,
`Guest::inject` and `tail_inject` use that same authority, including callbacks
sharing the owned syscall event. Allocation runs under those guest rights;
Linux's actual returned PKRU is retained even on errno, and callback rights are
restored before private runtime storage is accessed. Other private injections
keep their existing gate. On OSPKE systems, this host refuses `pkey_alloc` with
EOPNOTSUPP before allocation when no saved guest PKRU is available, including
installed hooks and instruction callbacks without an owned rights image. This
reduces support for both valid and invalid allocation arguments at those
locations; refusal does not establish native allocation semantics there. Without
OSPKE, Linux supplies the allocation result without PKRU instructions. The
existing SIGALRM-handler admission restriction still returns ENOSPC first.
This applies only to the shared typed Tool host: LiteInst's direct strace/compat
forwarding and nested Tool forwarding bypass it and retain their existing gaps.
It does not repair installed-hook XSAVE ownership or establish permission-effect
parity for `pkey_free`, `mprotect`, `pkey_mprotect` or execute-only `mmap`.

The shared preload protection-key test compares native execution with both
signal-stack modes: 12 read/write cases, four actual partial transfers, and 24
clock/time/signal-action buffer cases. It checks raw errno, unchanged refused
buffers, pipe and signal-disposition effects, and returned PKRU. Successful clock
outputs are checked for valid values rather than identical wall-clock timestamps.
Direct installed hooks, deferred Tool injection and guest-memory policy emulation
still need their own permission provenance and are outside this measurement.
These cases do not establish complete backend PKRU parity.
Deferred typed callbacks already run with runtime PKRU zero: their `LocalMemory`
C-string reads and writes can access a key-denied guest buffer that a native
syscall rejects. Beyond the bounded `pkey_alloc` support above, protection-key
effects of Tool injection, indirect policy reads and the separate CPUID/RDTSC
SIGSEGV entry remain unqualified.

## Patch publication modes

`install_tool_quiescent` uses LiteInst2's quiescent entrypoint. Its caller
asserts that no other application thread can execute while a site is
installed; Hermit, which runs one guest thread at a time, satisfies that
contract. Planning and relocation remain unchanged, so this route can patch a
cache-line straddler without registering WordPatch++ traps.

By default the in-process SIGSYS dispatcher uses concurrent publication,
because other application threads may fetch the site; `install_tool` and
`install_tool_from_bootstrap` select it. Single-line patches publish
atomically. Split patches retain the full guarded WordPatch++ protocol and
require `REVERIE_LITEINST_STRADDLER_STALENESS_TICKS` to be set above the
machine's measured `Tmax`; without that calibration they fail closed to the
trap path. The dispatcher publishes quiescently only when the tool was
installed with `install_tool_quiescent`, under the caller assertion above.
vDSO sites are also published quiescently, during initialization and before
any application thread starts.

## Current boundaries

- Dynamically linked, non-`AT_SECURE` Linux x86-64 guests only.
- One thread per process is supported by `LiteinstBackend`. Plain `fork` creates
  a fresh child-local `Tool` and reconnects to the shared coordinator. The same
  path accepts process-like `clone3`; `vfork` is translated to a COW child and
  preserves parent suspension through child exit. The coordinator drains
  inherited RPC connections to follow outliving and signaled descendants
  without attaching ptrace. Thread-style clone remains fail closed.
- Patchable and unpatchable syscalls dispatch the Tool in guest, and intercepted normal exits
  route thread and process callbacks on the supported single-threaded path.
  CPUID and RDTSC/RDTSCP route through the Tool; determinized CPUID responses
  hide RDRAND/RDSEED from conforming guests.
- Subscribed vDSO symbols share ptrace's authoritative symbol table, are
  rewritten into syscall entry sites before activation, and use ordinary
  LiteInst Tool hooks.
- Tool mode resets callable signal dispositions before activation, rejects
  later callable handlers, and validates that SIGSYS came from seccomp.
  `SIG_DFL` and `SIG_IGN` remain supported; guest signal handlers remain
  unsupported.
- Denying access to registered glibc rseq metadata can make native signal
  delivery fail in the kernel before any handler runs. A short native syscall
  can survive that denial, while LiteInst's mandatory SIGSYS interception
  triggers the kernel's rseq check and fails. The protected-stack fixture
  unregisters its own rseq area for both native and Tool controls; the runtime
  does not unregister production guests. Direct installed-hook behavior for
  this registered-rseq case remains unmeasured.
- Timer arming (`set_timer` and `set_timer_precise`) is refused with `ENOSYS`,
  because nothing in the guest delivers a timer event; a Tool that needs
  preemption fails closed instead of running unpreempted. Clock reads use a
  calling-thread RDPMC RCB counter and deduct branches retired inside active
  LiteInst handlers. Hosts that deny perf-event access report the clock as
  unsupported. This is not PMU preemption or complete scheduling support.
- Rust tool futures must make progress synchronously. Coordinator RPC and guest
  syscall injection do so; a tool future that depends on an unrelated executor
  can stall.
- The five-byte patch window and executable mapping must be supported by
  `liteinst2` to install a hook. Unpatchable syscalls use deferred Tool dispatch;
  other intercepted instructions still require a prepared reachable arena.
- `execve` cannot safely cross the inherited filter because the handler and DSO
  mappings disappear. It remains fail closed; completing exec requires a
  non-seccomp in-guest coverage mechanism or another bootstrap that does not
  reintroduce a ptracer.
- Process exits complete asynchronously (`BackendCapabilities::
  process_exits_complete_asynchronously`): a guest process leaves the host some
  time after the tool grants its exit. A tool that holds scheduling until each
  exit is physically complete (Hermit's Detcore does) needs the coordinator's
  owner to report completions; `LiteinstBackend::with_connection_admission`
  hands it each connecting process's pidfd for that. Under such a hold, these
  topologies cannot make progress, because the exiting process waits on
  another guest that needs a scheduler turn:
  - a guest serving FUSE or CUSE (holding a `/dev/fuse` or `/dev/cuse` device
    descriptor) or holding a seccomp user-notification listener: refused by
    the tool with a named error;
  - a guest serving a kernel network-filesystem client (NFS, CIFS, 9p) mounted
    outside the guest set: unsupported. A tool can only detect the stall
    (Hermit fails the run by name after a 1 s kernel wait or its 60 s
    watchdog); a soft mount whose retry budget expires in under 1 s can
    complete with semantics that differ from a ptrace run;
  - a guest serving another guest's userfaultfd faults: supported, but a stall
    is only detected, as for the network-filesystem case.
- This is in-process instrumentation, not a security sandbox.

Hermit CLI linkage and a published `liteinst2` revision are separate integration
steps. The direct Backend harness has run Detcore with `/bin/echo`, `/bin/true`,
and `/bin/cat /dev/null`; this does not make `hermit --backend liteinst` real
until that CLI path constructs `LiteinstBackend` and the corresponding Detcore
preload DSO on the same landed revisions.

## Fallback-surface observability

The runtime exports C-ABI counters that make the size and shape of the residual
fallback surface — trapped syscalls without an installed hook
— observable from the guest:

- `reverie_liteinst_site_trap_count(address)` / `reverie_liteinst_site_hook_count(address)`
  — the per-**site** breakdown keyed by the un-patched instruction's address.
- `reverie_liteinst_fallback_dispatch_count()` — the process-wide total of
  syscalls that reached fallback dispatch, including successful typed Tool calls.
- `reverie_liteinst_fallback_syscall_count(number)` — the per-syscall-number
  breakdown, keyed the same way as `reverie_e9patch_fallback_syscall_count` so
  the two ld-preload backends expose a symmetric metric.
- `reverie_liteinst_fallback_refusal_count()` and
  `reverie_liteinst_fallback_syscall_refusal_count(number)` report the subset
  refused by the runtime before Tool dispatch, including an instruction-state
  restoration failure. A Tool's own error result does not count as a refusal.

The legacy dispatch counter counts attempts, including this refusal subset.
Enabled statistics classify a refused attempt as `fallback_refusal`, exclusive
with successful `cacheline_straddler` or `unpatchable_or_other` fallback paths.
The common `in_guest_sigsys` delivery count includes both outcomes.

These counters are **per-process**: they are process-global statics, so a
`fork`/`clone` child copy-on-write inherits the parent's accumulated values.
Left alone, a child would report the parent's residual surface and hook activity
as its own. In compatibility/strace mode LiteInst forwards a fork-like syscall
itself (bare `fork`, or a `clone` with a null child stack, `SIGCHLD` as its exit
signal, and no flags beyond `CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID`, `CLONE_CHILD_SETTID` and
`CLONE_PARENT_SETTID`, which covers glibc's `fork`; raw `vfork` and `clone3` are
refused with `ENOTSUP` before forwarding), so `process_syscall`
invokes the shared
[`reverie_inguest::fork::ForkHook`] seam in the child (guarded by the shared
`is_fork_like` classifier and a zero return value): immediately after the fork
returns `0` in the child, `reset_fallback_observability` clears inherited
counters so the child's attribution starts clean. Typed Tool mode then records
the child's actual fork dispatch method: an installed hook remains a hook,
while deferred fallback records a trap and successful fallback, not a hook. Only the observability fields
are reset — the site registry's functional patch state (address, hook, mapping
generation) is left intact because the child COW-inherits the installed hooks and
the same executable mappings, so its instrumentation keeps working. The reset is
relaxed-atomic and allocation/lock-free, so it is safe to run in the child from
inside the `SIGSYS` handler. This is the *same* fork-following seam and
reviewed-once mechanism reverie-e9patch uses for its per-process fallback
counters (round 7); LiteInst hosts its own dispatcher rather than the shared
`PassthroughDispatcher`, so it calls the hook directly, but reuses the shared
`ForkHook`/`is_fork_like` API rather than a private fork-detection path.

## Corpus sweep scorecard

A 20-program C corpus was run through `hermit --backend liteinst run --strict
--verify` and compared against native and the ptrace backend (full harness,
CSV, and per-program logs live in the `dev-hermit` parent workspace under
`experiments/liteinst_corpus_sweep_20260728/`, not in this repo). The result
is historical evidence from July 2026, not a qualification of the current
in-process runtime or a current L2 measurement:

- **Single-process / single-thread C: 16/16 reported repeat comparisons.** Every non-boundary program
  (arithmetic, heap, file I/O, env, libm, clocks, libc `rand`, `argv`,
  recursion, buffered stdio, `getrandom`, anonymous `mmap`, `gmtime`)
  determinized to a bitwise-identical repeat run, matching the ptrace baseline.
  Where a source is non-reproducible, LiteInst determinizes it *correctly*:
  `getpid` (spoofed PID) and `getrandom` (deterministic bytes) both diverge from
  native by design. Canonical L2 assurance is not established by these results.
- **Four boundary modes were reported in that historical sweep**,
  shared with e9patch because both ld-preload backends routed
  clone/fork through the same `reverie-inguest` dispatcher and share this
  crate's signal/timer policy: thread `clone` and `fork` are rejected, a
  callable guest signal handler is rejected (fail-closed, nonzero exit), and an
  armed timer never fires (the guest spins to timeout).

### Caution: `--verify` cannot detect an ignored clone/fork rejection

`--verify` proves run₁ == run₂, **not** run == native. A guest that ignores the
errno from a rejected `clone`/`fork` and keeps running reaches a wrong but
perfectly reproducible result, which `--verify` then reports as "Determinism
verified" with `rc = 0`. In the sweep, the threaded and `fork` programs produced
degraded single-process output despite a successful repeat comparison. This is a
property of the shared clone/fork policy plus `--verify` semantics, not a
LiteInst-only defect; such a repeat comparison does not establish correct
thread or process behavior. Current support is described above. The
rejection itself is covered by `unsafe_clone_is_rejected_in_compatibility_and_strace_modes`
and the compatibility-fork tests in `tests/strace.rs`.
